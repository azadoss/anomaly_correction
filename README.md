## Overview

A web app that can classify how likely specific mutations in DNA are to cause diseases (variant effect prediction). Using the state-of-the-art Evo2 large language model for prediction the pathogenicity of single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Deployed on FastAPI Python backend on an H100 serverless GPU with Modal for analysis. A web app where users can select a genome assembly, browse its chromosomes or search for specific genes like BRCA1, and view the gene's reference genome sequence. The user can input a mutation in the gene and predict its pathogenicity with AI, but the user can also pick from a list of existing known variations, and compare the Evo2 prediction (pathogenic/benign) against existing ClinVar classifications.

### Todo

[ðŸš§] This is on-going project to add for internal use for [Anamnesai.com](https://anamnesai.com) a Medical data analysis app that I'm currently building...<br>
[â€¢] Gigabite size CSV file analysis with context window more than 1M+ rows and 20+ columns EEG analysis for K. Anna from [Epilepsy Reasearch Clinic Almaty](klinikasavinova.kz).(Waiting for proper open source model with 10M+ context window to test 880MB cvs with EEG raw data)<br>
[â€¢] Collabrate with Atyrau biodoc ...
