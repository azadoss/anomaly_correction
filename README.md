## Overview

A web app that can classify how likely specific mutations in DNA are to cause diseases (variant effect prediction). Using the state-of-the-art Evo2 large language model for prediction the pathogenicity of single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Deployed on FastAPI Python backend on an H100 serverless GPU with Modal for analysis. A web app where users can select a genome assembly, browse its chromosomes or search for specific genes like BRCA1, and view the gene's reference genome sequence. The user can input a mutation in the gene and predict its pathogenicity with AI, but the user can also pick from a list of existing known variations, and compare the Evo2 prediction (pathogenic/benign) against existing ClinVar classifications. The web app is built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI and is based off of the T3 Stack.
